A bank website. This project was developed as an exercise in Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course.

See the final result: https://chipa014-bankist.netlify.app/

Functionality:

This website has several modern features, such as tab and slider components, sticky navigation bar with smooth animations, smooth section reveal, lazy image loading and modal windows.

I also fixed a bug in the exercise: due to section reveal animations featuring an upwards movement, scrolling to it via navigation bar when it's not yet loaded resulted in scrolling lower than expected and part of the text was half-covered by the navigation bar.

Initial HTML/CSS by Jonas Schmedtmann.
